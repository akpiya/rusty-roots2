# .RRIGNORE FILE
# This is a file to specify paths to ignore when using rusty-roots!!
# It works similar to .gitignore, but is a bit stricter and follows Glob patterns.

# note: Running with this .rrignore file will effectively ignore everything.
# Remove some glob patterns here to actually get an output when using the --ignore flag.
